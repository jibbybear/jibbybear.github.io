Ola and welcome! My name is Jacob, and I am a geographer and drone pilot. I am a motivated graduate student pursuing a M.S. in Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Connecticut. My skills include cartography, unmanned aircraft systems, data visualization, and Portuguese!

My previous work experience in wildlife conservation and water management inspired my interest in natural resource protection. But my customer service experience motivated me to pursue a career working with stakeholders to improve their adaptive capacity to future environmental changes. I am extremely interested in applying my knowledge and skills to promote land stewardship through public engagement and improve climate resiliency for vulnerable communities.

## Research
My master's research is focused on the human dimensions of forest management. Currently, I am applying social network analysis and qualitative methods to evaluate how stakeholder management objectives and attitudes towards multiple forest stressors affect the structure of the forest management social network. I plan to evaluate how interrelationships among the forest management community affects management of forest stressors and electric utility resiliency.
